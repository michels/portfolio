I am a serial entrepreneur who got awarded for his work multiple times. My latest company flinc, a dynamic ridesharing service, got acquired by Daimler in September 2017.

### Being flinc and flott
![flinc](img/posts/flinc.png "flinc")

I co-founded flinc in 2010 and led the company as Managing Director and Chief Product officer until its acquisition in 2017. With over 500k registered users and well-known investors like General Motors Ventures and Deutsche Bahn Ventures it was one of the leading platforms in Central Europe. Large enterprise customers like BASF, P&G, Hugo Boss etc made it market leader in Corporate Ridesharing.

In 2016 we introduced a subbrand "flott" which was specialised in providing an on-demand mobility platform as well as conducting big data simulations of traffic scenarios especially in the autonomous car sector.
