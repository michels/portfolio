I co-initiated Impact Week in 2015 to foster innovation and entrepreneurship as well as
intercultural and intercompany exchange through Design Thinking. Since then we conducted events in Colombia, Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya and trained over 400 people in Design Thinking. In 2018 we will grow in even more countries.

### "Land der Ideen"
The Impact Week got awarded as one of the "Excellent Places in the Land of Ideas" 2018 by the German Initiative “Germany – Land of Ideas”. For the annual motto "Connecting Worlds – Strengthening Cohesion" the project demonstrates how experimentation, curiosity and courage to rethink developing aid can foster pioneering innovations in developing and emerging countries.
