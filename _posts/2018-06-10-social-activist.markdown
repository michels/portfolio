I co-initiated Impact Week in 2015 to foster innovation and entrepreneurship as well as
intercultural and intercompany exchange through Design Thinking. Since then we conducted events in Colombia, Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya and trained over 400 people in Design Thinking. In 2018 we will grow in even more countries.
